# Break and Continue Statements
## <a href="example1.cpp">Continue Statement</a>
Continue statement is used to skip to the next iteration of that loop. This
means that it stops one iteration of the loop. All the statements present
after the continue statement in that loop are not executed.
## <a href="example2.cpp">Break Statement</a>
Break statement is used to terminate the current loop. As soon as the break
statement is encountered in a loop, all further iterations of the loop are
stopped and control is shifted to the first statement after the end of loop.
